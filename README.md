# Customer Purchase Prediction using KNN

This project predicts whether a customer will purchase a product based on demographic and salary information using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification algorithm.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
Given customer data from social network advertisements, predict whether a user will purchase a product or not.

---

## 📂 Dataset
- Dataset: Social Network Ads
- Features:
  - Gender
  - Age
  - Estimated Salary
- Target:
  - Purchased (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

Dataset is stored in the `Data/` folder.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🔍 Methodology
1. Data loading and exploration
2. Data preprocessing:
   - Dropping unnecessary columns
   - Encoding categorical variables
3. Feature selection
4. Train-test split (75% training, 25% testing)
5. Model training using KNN (K=5)
6. Model evaluation using:
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Accuracy Score
7. Prediction for a new customer

## 📊 Model Evaluation
- Confusion Matrix
- Accuracy Score

---

## 🧪 New Customer Prediction
The model predicts whether a new customer will purchase the product based on input features like gender, age, and salary.

---

## ✅ Conclusion
The KNN model successfully classifies customer purchase behavior and demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow from data preprocessing to prediction.

---

## 📌 Future Improvements
- Feature scaling
- Hyperparameter tuning
